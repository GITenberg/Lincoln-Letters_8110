LINCOLN LETTERS

Published by The Bibilophile Society

NOTE

The letters herein by Lincoln are so thoroughly characteristic of
the man, and are in themselves so completely self-explanatory, that
it requires no comment to enable the reader fully to understand and
appreciate them. It will be observed that the philosophical
admonitions in the letter to his brother, Johnston, were written on
the same sheet with the letter to his father.

The promptness and decision with which Lincoln despatched the
multitudinous affairs of his office during the most turbulent
scenes of the Civil War are exemplified in his unequivocal order to
the Attorney-General, indorsed on the back of the letter of Hon.
Austin A. King, requesting a pardon for John B. Corner. The
indorsement bears even date with the letter itself, and Corner was
pardoned on the following day.


THE ORIGINALS FROM WHICH THE WITHIN FACSIMILES WERE MADE ARE IN THE
COLLECTION OF MR. WILLIAM K. BIXBY, AND THROUGH HIS COURTESY THEY
ARE REPRODUCED FOR MEMBERS OF THE BIBLIOPHILE SOCIETY


[Transcriber's Note: The following letters, to Lincoln's father and
brother, make up files linc01.jpg, linc02.jpg, and linc03.jpg]

Washington, Dec. 24th, 1848.

My dear father:--

Your letter of the 7th was received night before last. I very
cheerfully send you the twenty dollars, which sum you say is
necessary to save your land from sale. It is singular that you
should have forgotten a judgment against you; and it is more
singular that the plaintiff should have let you forget it so long,
particularly as I suppose you have always had property enough to
satisfy a judgment of that amount. Before you pay it, it would be
well to be sure you have not paid it; or, at least, that you can
not prove you have paid it. Give my love to Mother, and all the
connections.

Affectionately your son,

A. LINCOLN.


[Written on same page with above.]

Dear Johnston:--

Your request for eighty dollars, I do not think it best to comply
with now. At the various times when I have helped you a little, you
have said to me, "We can get along very well now," but in a very
short time I find you in the same difficulty again. Now this can
only happen by some defect in your conduct. What that defect is, I
think I know. You are not _lazy_, and still you _are_ an _idler_. I
doubt whether since I saw you, you have done a good whole day's
work, in any one day. You do not very much dislike to work, and
still you do not work much, merely because it does not seem to you
that you could get much for it. This habit of uselessly wasting
time, is the whole difficulty; and it is vastly important to you,
and still more so to your children, that you should break this
habit. It is more important to them, because they have longer to
live, and can keep out of an idle habit before they are in it
easier than they can get out after they are in.

You are now in need of some ready money; and what I propose is,
that you shall go to work, "tooth and nail," for somebody who will
give you money for it. Let father and your boys take charge of
things at home--prepare for a crop, and make the crop; and you go
to work for the best money wages, or in discharge of any debt you
owe, that you can get. And to secure you a fair reward for your
labor, I now promise you that for every dollar you will, between
this and the first of next May, get for your own labor either in
money or in your own indebtedness, I will then give you one other
dollar. By this, if you hire yourself at ten dollars a month, from
me you will get ten more, making twenty dollars a month for your
work. In this, I do not mean you shall go off to St. Louis, or the
lead mines, or the gold mines, in California, but I mean for you to
go at it for the best wages you can get close to home, in Coles
County. Now if you will do this, you will soon be out of debt, and
what is better, you will have a habit that will keep you from
getting in debt again. But if I should now clear you out, next year
you will be just as deep in as ever. You say you would almost give
your place in Heaven for $70 or $80. Then you value your place in
Heaven very cheaply, for I am sure you can with the offer I make
you get the seventy or eighty dollars for four or five months'
work. You say if I furnish you the money you will deed me the land,
and if you don't pay the money back, you will deliver possession--
Nonsense! If you can't now live _with_ the land, how will you then
live without it? You have always been kind to me, and I do not now
mean to be unkind to you. On the contrary, if you will but follow
my advice, you will find it worth more than eight times eighty
dollars to you.

Affectionately your brother,

A. LINCOLN.


[Transcriber's Note: The following letter to General Grant is
contained in file linc04.jpg]

Executive Mansion,
Washington, April 30, 1864.

Lieutenant-General Grant,--

Not expecting to see you again before the spring campaign opens, I
wish to express, in this way, my entire satisfaction with what you
have done up to this time, so far as I understand it. The
particulars of your plans I neither know, or seek to know. You are
vigilant and self reliant; and, pleased with this, I wish not to
obtrude any constraints or restraints upon you. While I am very
anxious that any great disaster, or the capture of our men in great
numbers, shall be avoided, I know these points are less likely to
escape your attention than they would be mine. If there is anything
wanting which is within my power to give, do not fail to let me
know it.

And now with a brave Army, and a just cause, may God sustain you.

Yours very truly,

A. LINCOLN.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
